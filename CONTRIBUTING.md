# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving this project. A few lightweight guidelines:

- Keep PRs small and focused.
- If you change audio-control logic, please note OS compatibility (pycaw is Windows-only).
- Add tests or a short demo script for new features where practical.
- Document usage in `README.md`.

If you want guidance for platform-specific audio control (macOS / Linux), open an issue describing your target platform and I can help.
